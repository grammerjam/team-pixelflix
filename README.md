## Setting Up PixelFlix
**Prerequisites:** Ensure you have Node.js (version 14 or later) and npm installed on your development machine.  
**Clone the Repository:** Use git to clone this repository to your local machine.  
**Install Dependencies:** Navigate to the project directory and run npm install to install all required dependencies.

### Running PixelFlix Locally
**Firebase Configuration:** Create a Firebase project and configure it with the application. Follow the Firebase documentation for setting up a web app and creating a Firestore database. Replace the placeholder values in the code with your actual Firebase project configuration.  
**Start the Development Server:** Run npm start in your terminal. This will start a local development server and open PixelFlix in your web browser (usually at http://localhost:3000).
